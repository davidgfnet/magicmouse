Magic Mouse
===========

This is a USB device for stm32f103 that enumerates as a Keyboard+Mouse combo
and performs automated actions. By default acts as a mouse jiggler, moving the
mouse every 30 seconds.

The device is configurable and can be programmed with a custom configuration
to perform certain periodic actions. There's a WebUSB config util that allows
config pushes, wipe and even DFU reboots.
